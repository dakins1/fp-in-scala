# fp-in-scala
This is my implementation of the exercies from the book *Functional Programming in Scala* by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason. I don't solve every exercise or implement every function the in the book, but I do solve what interests me or seems like an important thing to practice. 

Sometimes the code here is copied from the book, and sometimes it is my own. I see no harm in copying; I place great value in coding muscle memory. It forces me to interact with the code, and I always walk away with better understanding than if I just read the code. In each section of this repo I have additional readme.md's that explain any design decisions I made that break away from the book.
